# Investment Growth Calculator
This program, implemented in C, calculates the number of years required for an investment to grow from an initial value to a specified end value based on a fixed annual interest rate. It is my first C project to get to know the language.

## Features
- command-line interface
- input validation
- flexible and customizable
## How to Use
1. Compile the program using a C compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable in your terminal.
3. Follow the prompts to provide the initial investment, annual interest rate (as a percentage), and desired end value for your investment.
4. The program will calculate and display the estimated number of years required for your investment to grow to the specified end value.

## Requirements
A C compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile and run the program.
Standard C library (stdio.h, math.h) is required for input/output and mathematical calculations.
